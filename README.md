# Cryptocurrency-Market-Data-Aggregator
Designed and implemented a robust Cryptocurrency Market Data Aggregator, integrating data from diverse sources to provide a comprehensive view of the cryptocurrency market. Leveraged web scraping, API integration, and data processing techniques to collect real-time information from prominent cryptocurrency exchanges (e.g., Binance, Coinbase), news websites (e.g., CoinDesk), social media platforms (e.g., Twitter, Reddit), and blockchain explorers (e.g., Etherscan)

## Key Accomplishments:

- Multi-Source Integration: Successfully aggregated and harmonized disparate data types, including price, volume, order book data, news sentiment, social media trends, and blockchain transactions.

- Data Standardization and Cleansing: Implemented robust data processing pipelines to standardize formats, handle missing data, and ensure data quality, enhancing the reliability of the aggregated information.

- Database Management: Established a scalable and efficient database schema (utilizing PostgreSQL/MongoDB) for storing processed data, enabling seamless data retrieval and analysis.

- Automation and Scheduling: Implemented automated data collection and processing tasks using Apache Airflow, ensuring timely and consistent updates. Implemented error handling mechanisms for improved reliability.

- Visualization and Analysis: Utilized Matplotlib and Plotly to create interactive visualizations, enabling stakeholders to gain insights into cryptocurrency market trends. Conducted exploratory data analysis to identify patterns and correlations.

- Alerting System: Developed an alerting system to notify users of significant market events, such as price fluctuations and sudden volume changes, enhancing real-time awareness.

- Ethical and Legal Compliance: Ensured adherence to ethical standards and legal requirements in data collection and analysis processes. Respected terms of use for data sources and APIs.

- Optional: Machine Learning Integration: Explored opportunities to integrate machine learning models for predictive analysis and anomaly detection based on historical data, enhancing the project's analytical capabilities.

This project showcases a strong combination of technical skills, data engineering expertise, and the ability to integrate and process data from diverse sources for meaningful insights.
